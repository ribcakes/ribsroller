#summary Intro & User Manual

= Rib's Roller =

Rib's Roller is a dice rolling application.  It was originally designed with Dungeons and Dragons© in mind, but as the project progressed, it has deviated from the d20 System©.  The program now supports the ability to make dice of any kind in any combination.  

= Installation =
An installation package for installation can be obtained either through the Android Market or from this website.  I would suggest downloading the application from the market as it will notify you to any updates whereas an installation package obtained here will not.

If you are viewing this web page on your phone, you can go to the following link to download the app from the market:
