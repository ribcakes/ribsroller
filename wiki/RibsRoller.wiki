#summary Intro & User Manual

= Rib's Roller =

Rib's Roller is a dice rolling application.  It was originally designed with Dungeons and Dragons© in mind, but as the project progressed, it has deviated from the d20 System©.  The program now supports the ability to make dice of any kind in any combination.  

= Installation =
An installation package for installation can be obtained either through the Android Market or from this website.  I would suggest downloading the application from the market as it will notify you to any updates whereas an installation package obtained here will not.
